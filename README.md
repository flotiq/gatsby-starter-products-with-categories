Gatsby Starter: Ecommerce and Flotiq, products with categories
========================

# We are retiring this starter please use https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-gatsby-shop-1 and https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-gatsby-shop-2

This is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) starter project for ecommerce using [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com). It's configured to pull products and categories data from [Flotiq](https://flotiq.com) and can be easily deployed to your cloud hosting - Heroku, Netlify, Gatsby Cloud, etc.

Live Demo: https://flotiq-products-with-categorie.herokuapp.com

## Quick start

1. **Start the project from template using [Flotiq CLI]((https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-cli))**

    ```bash
   npm install -g flotiq-cli
   flotiq start [flotiqApiKey] [projectName] https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-products-with-categories.git
    ```
   * `flotiqApKey` - Read and write API key to your Flotiq account      
   * `projectName` - project name or project path (if you wish to start or import data from the current directory - use `.`)

1. **You can also start the project from template using Gatsby CLI**
    
    ```bash
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-products-with-categories https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-products-with-categories.git
    ```

1.  **Setup "Products" Content Type in Flotiq**

   Create your [Flotiq.com](https://editor.flotiq.com/register.html) account. 
   
   Next, create the `Category` and the `Product` Content Type:
   
   ![Create content type definition using Flotiq](docs/create-definition1.png)
   ![Create content type definition using Flotiq](docs/create-definition2.png)
   
   _Note: You can also create `Category` and `Product` using [Flotiq REST API](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/)_            
   
  
1.  **Configure application**

   The last step is to configure our application to know from where it has to fetch the data.
   You can also setup your Snipcart API_KEY to enable store functionality. 
   
   You need to create a file called `.env` inside the root of the directory, with the following structure:

   ```
   GATSBY_FLOTIQ_API_KEY=YOUR FLOTIQ API KEY
   SNIPCART_API_KEY=YOUR SNIPCART PUBLIC API KEY
   ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.
    
    ```sh
    cd gatsby-starter-products-with-categories
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
    This step is optional and is not necessary if you used flotiq-cli to start the project.
      
    If you wish to import example products to your account, before running `gatsby develop`, install [flotiq-cli](https://github.com/flotiq/flotiq-cli), and run in project directory:
      
    ```sh
    flotiq import [flotiqApiKey] .
    ```
    
    It will add 2 categories, 10 images and 4 products to your Flotiq account.
    
    _Note: You need to put your Read and write API key as the `flotiqApiKey` for import to work. You don't need `Category` and `Product` content types in your account. If you already have products with ids `product-1`, `product-2`, `product-3`, and `product-4` or categories with ids `category-1` and `category-2` they will be overwritten._

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
    
    Open a project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Manage your products using Flotiq editor**

    You can easily manage your products and categories using Flotiq editor
